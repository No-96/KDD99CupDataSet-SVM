Hi,
This is Ishaak and here are some of my suggestions for a NIDS.

1. Use for Feature selection algorithms like chi2 and correlation based selection.
2. Features of KDD99 are pretty distributed so it would be great if scenario based features are developed and used.
3. Encoding of Dataset.
4. Scaling and Normalising of the dataset would really boost the computation time and accuracy.
